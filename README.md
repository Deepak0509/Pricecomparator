 <b>Description</b>

 The program consists of a search bar in which people can type in what they want to search and it will be searched in Google and the
 top result will be displayed with its heading, brief description and link to visit. 
 If the result that appeared is not what the user was searching there is button which when clicked takes him to Google search page 
 with all the results so that he/she can find out what he/she wanted to search for.
 The program consists of a simple search box in which people can search for a product and can compare the prices in Amazon and Flipkart.
 After the user searches for a product, the program shows the product's name and price in Amazon and Flipkart.

 <b>Problems Faced</b>
 
 Figuring out how to scrap for any product instead of a single product took a lot of time. It was the first time I used Tkinter so
 it took me time to understand what it is and how to use it.

 <b>Scope of Improvement</b>
 
 Adding images of products, reviews and offers so that the user can get more information. Adding more websites to compare prices and 
 having a better GUI.
