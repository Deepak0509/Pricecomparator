 The program consists of a simple search box in which people can search for a product and can compare the prices in Amazon and Flipkart.
 After the user searches for a product, the program shows the product's name and price in Amazon and Flipkart.

 <b>Problems Faced</b>
 
 Figuring out how to scrap for any product instead of a single product took a lot of time. It was the first time I used Tkinter so
 it took me time to understand what it is and how to use it.

 <b>Scope of Improvement</b>
 
 Adding images of products, reviews and offers so that the user can get more information. Adding more websites to compare prices and 
 having a better GUI.
 
 <b>What have I learned</b>
 
 It was the first time I made something using Python. I learnt Web scraping and how to use Tkinter while making the project.
